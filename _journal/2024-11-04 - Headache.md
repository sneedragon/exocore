#  2024-11-04 - Headache

## DNP

Today I have a terrible headache.
I still managed to work on my my game for an hour and am writing this Journal entry for today.

The reason for this headache is most likely the fact, that I have been experimenting with DNP[^1] for the last 3 days, and I don't think my body can take it well, so I have decided to stop and cease all future attempts as well. 

[^1]: [Dinitrophenol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-Dinitrophenol), I don't recommend it.

The effect is just very counter-intuitive. It's not going to help a whole lot with cutting if it weakens you to the point you can't work out or be productive anymore.

I wanted to write more, but my head is killing me right now. I still have to prepare my tripe soup (Never eaten any before. I am curious how it will taste.)
