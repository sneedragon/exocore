# 2024-11-02 - Habits

## On writing and thoughts

I think I want to make it a habit to start writing at least one daily note into my Exocore. Writing is something I have long been putting off to actually start doing.
I think it is good for organizing your thoughts, especially when you look at how the best way to *really* understand something is when you put it in words to explain to someone else - at least that is how it is for me.

To give an example:
Often my wife would ask me to explain various things to her, say, something nutrition related. Then, in the middle of explaining something I would have an epiphany and not all too rarely I would stop mid-sentence, telling her that I *"must research something quickly"*, because I suddenly grasped something I didn't before and mentally envisioned a path to gaining greater understanding of the topic.

## Music

From new habits to old ones - I want to talk about music.
Sitting here in front of my riced out (I am quite happy with it) Linux PC, late in the evening, writing this note, while I honestly should have been in bed continuing to read Don Quixote stories in Infrared- and Candlelight an hour ago already, I really get this wonderful feeling of melancholic Nostalgia. It feels like a virtual metaphor of watching the stars.

*The book is quite large and I think it looks very unique. Note that this is not my photograph.*

A big part of this feeling is attributed to the music I started listening to again quite recently.
Music has sort of fallen out of favor for me in recent times. Usually I just prefer the sound of my surroundings or simply the silence. But every now and then I stumble upon something like a new(or old) Album by Windows96.

And I start listening to it almost out of subconscious action. 
I can not pinpoint why exactly I like this type of Vaporwave music so much. It just invokes that strange feeling of nostalgia for a place that doesn't even exist.
Maybe, it can be attributed to the ethereal, dreamlike or retro aesthetics that almost everything in the genre exudes. 
Years ago, I even had a double digit gigabyte archive of all kinds of Vaporwave tracks, from popular (although less so, since I kind of despised nu-Vaporwave like Blank Banshee or the skinwalking future funk genre often confused with it. (which has grown onto me by now)) to old and borderline, if not entirely, lost tracks to completely unknown ones from promising new artists I would scan Youtube and Soundcloud for almost daily.
I don't think I have ever even remotely been interested in collecting any media/data like that before or after, but Microsoft put an end to all of it anyway when I woke up one night to see my PC in a forced 7>10 Windows Upgrade (this was around 2016?) I had previously declined the day before.  
That update corrupted my hard drive entirely and everything was lost.

## Thanks, Bill.

I still listened to it semi-frequently up until a certain point I don't remember, but I keep going back to it every now and then anyway - usually to listen to the aforementioned Windows96. His discography is simply unmatched and I can not think of a single bad work, which is incredibly impressive when you consider the sheer amount of output he has as well.

My old website I unfortunately lost all files for had an auto-playing Youtube embed of this in the center. I often liked just going on my own website and taking it all in. It had pleasant colors and a night-sky background not too dissimilar to [the one used as the default Exocore theme](https://exocore.netlify.app/). Although it was not animated and a bit simpler if my memory serves me right. I miss it.

## Plans

As told in the first section, I plan on making a habit on daily notes. These will be more like personal blog posts, and I doubt anyone will find much use for them. They are merely stream of thought writing. Thought practice. This is my brain gym.
Fittingly for the topic of the day, I just realized I was writing these in the wrong category and **Journal** category is meant for posts like this, as opposed to the **Daily** one. Honestly, I don't like the ambiguousness of that naming system. I would rather switch these names But I just moved this one, as well as the previous post either way. I won't edit the use of the word *"daily notes"* in this or the previous post. Stream of thought. I don't care.
