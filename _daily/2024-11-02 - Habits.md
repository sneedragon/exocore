# 2024-11-02 - Habits

I think I want to make it a habit to start writing at least one daily note into my Exocore. Writing is something I have long been putting off to actually start doing.
I think it is good for organizing your thoughts, especially when you look at how the best way to *really* understand something is when you put it in words to explain to someone else - at least that is how it is for me.

To give an example:
Often my wife would ask me to explain various things to her, say, something nutrition related. Then, in the middle of explaining something I would have an epiphany and not all too rarely I would stop mid-sentence, telling her that I *"must research something quickly"*, because I suddenly grasped something I didn't before and mentally envisioned a path to gaining greater understanding of the topic.
